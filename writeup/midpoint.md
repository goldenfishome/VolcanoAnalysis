* This is the well computed interactive viz made by Leaflet.

* Leaflet Map Visualization: This is a Leaflet Map plot generated by R with the “Mapview” library. By clicking each point shown in the map, it shows the corresponding Volcano Name, Country, Volcano Type, Last Eruption period, Region, Sub-Region, Latitude, Longitude, Rock Type and so on. This map is easy to follow and can interactively by selecting different kinds of maps background at the top right corner. It’s clear to see that most volcano activities happen along the coasts’ side and in islands with several occurring in the middle of oceans. The plot shows that the country of Indonesia, Canada, the USA, and Japan has the most overlapping scatters of volcano activities which can be helpful for scientists and readers to do prediction and related analysis.


## Discription of encoding choices

#Countries with Holocene Volcanoes:

This plot is made by python plotly. Data source is from dataset2, which includes the information about eruption era, countries and number of volcanoes. According to this plot, the volcano's active area is relatively stable. The first five most active areas are Indonesia, Japan, the United States, Russia and Chile. Since these countries are next to the earthquake zone, we are very familiar with them from different sources of social media. And according to the axis range of the scatter plot, we can also find that earth has become more and more inactive. In other words, volcanoes are going to go dormant. After searching on google, we found it might be because that magma from the Earth's mantle can no longer reach the volcanoes, and then they do not have enough energy to erupt.

#The area of activity where volcanic eruptions last between 1-2 years

This plot shows the area of activity where volcanic eruptions last between one to two years (duration days between 365-730). The color of the point in this plot is marked as the status of VEI, which is a relative measure of the explosiveness of volcanic eruptions, from non-explosive to very large explosive. It can be observed that moderate explosive volcanoes are the most common and volcanoes are rarely non-explosive or large explosive, there are no volcanoes with very large explosiveness. As we can see, the duration of eruptions is evenly distributed over a period of one to two years.

#The spread of volcanic explosivity index

The spread of volcanic explosivity index is relatively spread randomly across the world. Based on the value of longitude and latitude, we can find that active volcanoes focus on and swarm around Southeast Asia, East Asia, the east coast of the Americas and the Mediterranean continent. And mostly are moderate explosive volcanoes.

#Comparison between Eruption Categories:

Here shows the comparison between volcano eruption evidence categories. Using the end year as x axis, but there still exists some continuously erupting volcanoes, thus, here we used last eruption year as our x label. From this density plot, we can know that uncertain and confirmed eruptions observed mostly after year 2000 increased high compared to eruption dated, however, discredited eruptions observed mostly after year 1960 increased high.

#Bar Plot of More Active Eruptions:

This bar plot presents volcanoes with more active eruptions(top40). It is clear that the Etna volcano in Italy has the most active eruptions with 104 times, mount Fournaise, Piton de la which lies in France has eruptions 70 times, following by volcano Asosan in Japan with 66 times eruptions. And more than half of the 40 most active volcanoes have had less than 20 eruptions.

#Volcano Eruption Global Distribution

This plot is created from the Python Plotly library. This interactive plot shows the distribution of volcano eruptions and earthquakes worldwide from 2010 to 2017. According to the plot, the red dots indicate the earthquakes that happen in a given month, and the blue dots represent the volcano eruptions. By moving the bar underplot, it shows the distribution of events at different time periods. Hovering over the dots tells the type of the event, the month of the event, and the longitude and latitude of the event. In addition, the plot supports the function of panning, zooming, and box selection.
This plot used two datasets, one is Significant Earthquake 1965-2016, and the other is the Volcano Eruption Global Distribution 2010-2018. Since the earthquake dataset has a much longer time period than the volcano one, the rows outside the time period of the volcano eruption dataset are filtered out.
According to the plot, it can be seen that, in a given month, most volcano eruptions are surrounded by earthquakes. What is more, most volcano eruptions happen at places that historically had earthquakes. This observation is matched to the fact that volcanic eruptions and earthquakes are closely related geological movements. In addition, the visualization facilitates the data science story told earlier, the volcano eruption in Tonga is likely related to the earthquake, though the degree and specific timeline of earthquakes are unknown.

#Box plot about global distribution

These two plots are created from the Python Plotly library. This series of interactive visualization shows the descending order of the number of total deaths from volcano eruptions from 2010 to 2018. Since some countries have only a few entries of volcano eruptions, the data are presented as bars in the box plot. The volcano dataset has lots of missing values, here fill the missing values with the mean. This explains why many countries have the same number of total deaths. What is more, Indonesia has a much larger value at around 360, which results in the visualization in an uncoordinated design. In order to observe the total deaths in different countries in a better way, this project removes that row and plots a new visualization, which gives a better comparison of how total deaths vary by country.

#Volcano Scatter Plot:

This plot is created from the Python Plotly library. This visualization presents the relationship between the elevation of erupted volcanoes and the total number of deaths they caused from 2010 to 2017 with different volcanic statuses. The data used in this plot is from Volcano Eruption Global Distribution 2010-2018. According to the plot, many data points are at around total death of 19, this is because many missed values of this dataset are filled by the mean value. Ignore these numbers of total death at 19, you can still observe a slightly positive correlation between the elevation and number of deaths. However, there is not much information telling the different status of volcanoes distributed differently.
This visualization presents the relationship between the elevation of erupted volcanoes and the total number of deaths they caused from 2010 to 2017 with different volcanic statuses.

#Web and Networking Plot of Volcano

 These are three network plots made by support rule, confidence rule and lift rule. And the data resource is from dataset4. Here we choose “Volcano Country”, “Volcano Type”, “Volcano Status”, and “Volcano Time” to analyze their networking relationships. According to the plot made by the support rule, D1(Volcano Time) might have a network with historical and Stratovolcano type. According to the plot made by the confidence rule, Stratovolcano is the connected feature, and in such circumstances U and D1 are both important Volcano Time. In the lift rule, it is kind of like the confidence rule. While it gives more connection to Indonesia with historical status.
