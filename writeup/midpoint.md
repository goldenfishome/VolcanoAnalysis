* This is the well computed interactive viz made by Leaflet.

* Leaflet Map Visualization: This is a Leaflet Map plot generated by R with the “Mapview” library. By clicking each point shown in the map, it shows the corresponding Volcano Name, Country, Volcano Type, Last Eruption period, Region, Sub-Region, Latitude, Longitude, Rock Type and so on. This map is easy to follow and can interactively by selecting different kinds of maps background at the top right corner. It’s clear to see that most volcano activities happen along the coasts’ side and in islands with several occurring in the middle of oceans. The plot shows that the country of Indonesia, Canada, the USA, and Japan has the most overlapping scatters of volcano activities which can be helpful for scientists and readers to do prediction and related analysis.


## Discription of encoding choices

# Countries with Holocene Volcanoes:

This plot is made by python plotly. Data source is from dataset2, which includes the information about eruption era, countries and number of volcanoes. According to this plot, the volcano's active area is relatively stable. The first five most active areas are Indonesia, Japan, the United States, Russia and Chile. Since these countries are next to the earthquake zone, we are very familiar with them from different sources of social media. And according to the axis range of the scatter plot, we can also find that earth has become more and more inactive. In other words, volcanoes are going to go dormant. After searching on google, we found it might be because that magma from the Earth's mantle can no longer reach the volcanoes, and then they do not have enough energy to erupt.

# The area of activity where volcanic eruptions last between 1-2 years

This plot shows the area of activity where volcanic eruptions last between one to two years (duration days between 365-730). The color of the point in this plot is marked as the status of VEI, which is a relative measure of the explosiveness of volcanic eruptions, from non-explosive to very large explosive. It can be observed that moderate explosive volcanoes are the most common and volcanoes are rarely non-explosive or large explosive, there are no volcanoes with very large explosiveness. As we can see, the duration of eruptions is evenly distributed over a period of one to two years.

# The spread of volcanic explosivity index

The spread of volcanic explosivity index is relatively spread randomly across the world. Based on the value of longitude and latitude, we can find that active volcanoes focus on and swarm around Southeast Asia, East Asia, the east coast of the Americas and the Mediterranean continent. And mostly are moderate explosive volcanoes.

# Comparison between Eruption Categories:

Here shows the comparison between volcano eruption evidence categories. Using the end year as x axis, but there still exists some continuously erupting volcanoes, thus, here we used last eruption year as our x label. From this density plot, we can know that uncertain and confirmed eruptions observed mostly after year 2000 increased high compared to eruption dated, however, discredited eruptions observed mostly after year 1960 increased high.

# Bar Plot of More Active Eruptions:

This bar plot presents volcanoes with more active eruptions(top40). It is clear that the Etna volcano in Italy has the most active eruptions with 104 times, mount Fournaise, Piton de la which lies in France has eruptions 70 times, following by volcano Asosan in Japan with 66 times eruptions. And more than half of the 40 most active volcanoes have had less than 20 eruptions.

# Volcano Eruption Global Distribution

This plot is created from the Python Plotly library. This interactive plot shows the distribution of volcano eruptions and earthquakes worldwide from 2010 to 2017. According to the plot, the red dots indicate the earthquakes that happen in a given month, and the blue dots represent the volcano eruptions. By moving the bar underplot, it shows the distribution of events at different time periods. Hovering over the dots tells the type of the event, the month of the event, and the longitude and latitude of the event. In addition, the plot supports the function of panning, zooming, and box selection.
This plot used two datasets, one is Significant Earthquake 1965-2016, and the other is the Volcano Eruption Global Distribution 2010-2018. Since the earthquake dataset has a much longer time period than the volcano one, the rows outside the time period of the volcano eruption dataset are filtered out.
According to the plot, it can be seen that, in a given month, most volcano eruptions are surrounded by earthquakes. What is more, most volcano eruptions happen at places that historically had earthquakes. This observation is matched to the fact that volcanic eruptions and earthquakes are closely related geological movements. In addition, the visualization facilitates the data science story told earlier, the volcano eruption in Tonga is likely related to the earthquake, though the degree and specific timeline of earthquakes are unknown.

# Box plot about global distribution

These two plots are created from the Python Plotly library. This series of interactive visualization shows the descending order of the number of total deaths from volcano eruptions from 2010 to 2018. Since some countries have only a few entries of volcano eruptions, the data are presented as bars in the box plot. The volcano dataset has lots of missing values, here fill the missing values with the mean. This explains why many countries have the same number of total deaths. What is more, Indonesia has a much larger value at around 360, which results in the visualization in an uncoordinated design. In order to observe the total deaths in different countries in a better way, this project removes that row and plots a new visualization, which gives a better comparison of how total deaths vary by country.

# Volcano Scatter Plot:

This plot is created from the Python Plotly library. This visualization presents the relationship between the elevation of erupted volcanoes and the total number of deaths they caused from 2010 to 2017 with different volcanic statuses. The data used in this plot is from Volcano Eruption Global Distribution 2010-2018. According to the plot, many data points are at around total death of 19, this is because many missed values of this dataset are filled by the mean value. Ignore these numbers of total death at 19, you can still observe a slightly positive correlation between the elevation and number of deaths. However, there is not much information telling the different status of volcanoes distributed differently.
This visualization presents the relationship between the elevation of erupted volcanoes and the total number of deaths they caused from 2010 to 2017 with different volcanic statuses.

# Web and Networking Plot of Volcano

 These are three network plots made by support rule, confidence rule and lift rule. And the data resource is from dataset4. Here we choose “Volcano Country”, “Volcano Type”, “Volcano Status”, and “Volcano Time” to analyze their networking relationships. According to the plot made by the support rule, D1(Volcano Time) might have a network with historical and Stratovolcano type. According to the plot made by the confidence rule, Stratovolcano is the connected feature, and in such circumstances U and D1 are both important Volcano Time. In the lift rule, it is kind of like the confidence rule. While it gives more connection to Indonesia with historical status.


## Data Science Story and Visualization Description

15th Jan 2022, Georgetown University student Lisa Chen was shocked by the news of a volcanic eruption that happened in Tonga. She was very worried about the situation there since one of her best friends Fangu Fukofuka is from Tonga. Lisa texted Fangu right after she saw the news in the morning. 6 hours passed, and Fangu still did not text back. And the whole world had trouble connecting with Tonga as well. Lisa desperately wanted to know how devastating the effect of the volcanic eruption could be, and how possible it can be related to other natural disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis, etc.
 
She opened the website “VolcaKnows” and will see a dataset of the worldwide distribution of volcanoes, which have attributes of city, country, volcano type, and time of the eruption, along with a map plot of the dataset. The second part of the website shows the datasets with various properties and economic and human impacts of volcanoes. Lisa could filter the dataset by location, and see how the historical impacts of volcanic eruptions in the area near Tonga. Besides that, there is another dataset containing information about earthquakes that happened worldwide from the year 1965 to 2016, which can be plotted on the same map as the volcanic eruption to see if they are related to each other. As well as how frequently earthquakes happen in the close area of a volcanic eruption in a given time window.

To get an overview of the volcanic eruptions frequencies in a worldwide range, Lisa found data scientists at “VolcaKnows Company” and asked them for help to discover more information about Volcanoes. VolcaKnows data scientists then generated a Leaflet Map to help Lisa better know the countries and subregions with the most frequent eruptions with very accurate Latitude and Longitude. The Map also vividly shows the volcano types, names, their last eruption, and dominant rock types in Lisa’s friend’s country. 

Before analyzing the recent volcano data, Lisa wanted to have a look to the past era. So she asked the data scientists to make a plot to investigate the number of eruptions in different countries and eras. Then she found the first five most active areas are Indonesia, Japan, the United States, Russia and Chile. This is exactly what Lisa expected, since these countries are next to the earthquake zone. Lisa also found that earth had become more and more inactive by analyzing the axis range of the plot. In other words, volcanoes are going to go dormant. After searching on google, Lisa thought it might be because that magma from the Earth's mantle can no longer reach the volcanoes, and then they do not have enough energy to erupt.


Lisa has done research about how long volcanic eruptions last, so she tried to ask a data scientist to do a visualization of the area of activity where volcanic eruptions last between one to two years for her. And she was excited to find that the moderate explosive volcanoes are the most common and volcanoes are rarely non-explosive or large explosive, there are no volcanoes with very large explosiveness. An interesting fact she found is that the duration days of eruptions is evenly distributed over a period of one to two years. While she was browsing the Volcanopedia website, she became interested in a word called “Vei”, which is a relative measure of the explosiveness of volcanic eruptions. The spread of volcanic explosivity index is relatively spread randomly across the world. She found that active volcanoes focus on and swarm around Southeast Asia, East Asia, the east coast of the Americas and the Mediterranean continent. SInce there are three different kinds of eruption categories, Lisa observed that uncertain and confirmed eruptions observed mostly after year 2000 increased high compared to eruption dated, however, discredited eruptions observed mostly after year 1960 increased high. What is known to us is that there exist active volcanoes all over the world, so Lisa was wondering what are the top 40 active eruption volcanoes around the world, she discovered that the Etna volcano in Italy has the most active eruptions with 104 times, mount Fournaise, Piton de la which lies in France has eruptions 70 times, following by volcano Asosan in Japan with 66 times eruptions.



Lisa is interested in finding how the volcano eruptions are related to the earthquake. She saw an interactive plot from the website showing the distribution of volcano eruptions and earthquakes worldwide from 2010 to 2017. According to the plot, the red dots indicate the earthquakes that happen in a given month, and the blue dots represent the volcano eruptions. By moving the bar underplot, she can see the distribution of events at different time periods. From this plot, Lisa found that, in a given month, most volcano eruptions are surrounded by earthquakes. What is more, most volcano eruptions happen at places that historically had earthquakes. This indicates that volcanic eruptions and earthquakes are closely related geological movements. Earthquakes could be a concern, however, Lisa should also know that the degree and specific timeline of earthquakes are unknown, it could be a mild or not life-threatening earthquake, or an earthquake has already happened before the volcano eruption. 

After looking at the earthquake and volcano eruption visualization, Lisa was still worried about her friend. She started looking at the plot of the total number of deaths from volcanic eruptions in each country in the last 10 years. She got much more comforted when saw the data of the highest country Indonesia with a total death of around 20, which is not that crazy high number, though is still sad.

After one day without hearing back from Fangu, Lisa checked the “VolcaKnow” website again. This time she was looking at the visualization of the relationship between the elevation of erupted volcanoes and the total number of deaths they caused from 2010 to 2017 with different volcanic statuses, which has a slightly positive correlation between the elevation and total death. Knowing this fact, Lisa searched the elevation and types of volcanoes in Tonga, and tried to find how close the total death number was.

Besides analyzing the death related data. Lisa also wanted to find if there’s any connection between those text information. (e.g. “Volcano Country”, “Volcano Type”, “Volcano Status”, and “Volcano Time”) Therefore, the data scientists did ARM and networking analysis and created three network plots made by support rule, confidence rule and lift rule. According to the plot made by the support rule, Lisa thought D1(Volcano Time) might have a network with historical status and Stratovolcano type. According to the plot made by the confidence rule, Stratovolcano is the connected feature, and in such circumstances U and D1 are both important Volcano Time. In the lift rule, it is kind of like the confidence rule. While it gives more connection to Indonesia with historical status.
