  <h2 class="w3-center">Story Telling</h2><br>
 <p class="w3-medium"><span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey"> Overview: </span>
 Natural disasters, such as volcano eruptions, are catastrophic and extreme weather events. Although it can occur anytime around the world, some regions are more vulnerable and sensitive to specific kinds of disasters than others. Our group would like to use these datasets to tell a data science story about the eruption of volcanoes and the impact of volcanic activities on economics and other natural disasters. It has been known that natural disasters can heavily destroy people’s lives and livelihoods for example the recent news of volcanic eruption happened in Hawaii; the occured losses might even be the major obstacles to human’s sustainable development. Therefore, we are going to analyze the activities of volcanoes along with a given timeline, visualizing the influence of different geographical locations on volcano movements, the relationships between volcano types and various geo features, and its impact on economics. 

 </p>
  <p class="w3-medium"><span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey"> Story Background: </span>  15th Jan, 2022, the Georgetown University student Lisa Chen was shocked by the news of a volcanic eruption that happened in Tonga. She was very worried about the situation there, since one of her best friends Fangu Fukofuka is from Tonga. Lisa texted to Fangu right after she saw the news in the morning. 6 hours passed, Fangu still did not text back. And the whole world had trouble connecting with Tonga as well. Lisa desperately wanted to know how devastating the effect of the volcanic eruption could be, and how possibly it can be related to other natural disasters, including earthquakes, tsunami, etc. She opened the website “VolcaKnows”, she will see dataset of the worldwide distribution of volcanoes, which have attributes of city, country, volcano type and time of eruption, along with a map plot of the dataset. The second part of the website shows the datasets with various properties and economic and human impacts of volcanoes. Lisa could filter the dataset by location, and see how the historical impacts of volcanic eruptions like in the area near Tonga. Besides that, there is another dataset containing information about earthquakes that happened worldwide from the year 1965 to 2016, which can be plotted on the same map with the volcanic eruption to see if they are related to each other. As well as how frequently earthquakes happen in the close area of volcanic eruption in a given time window.  </p>

  <p class="w3-medium w3-text-grey"><span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey">Leaflet Map Visualization: </span>  This is a Leaflet Map plot generated by R with the “Mapview” library. By clicking each point shown in the map, it shows the corresponding Volcano Name, Country, Volcano Type, Last Eruption period, Region, Sub-Region, Latitude, Longitude, Rock Type and so on. This map is easy to follow and can interactively by selecting different kinds of maps background at the top right corner. It’s clear to see that most volcano activities happen along the coasts’ side and in islands with several occuring in the middle of oceans. The plot shows that the country of Indonesia, Canada, the USA, and Japan has the most overlapping scatters of volcano activities which can be helpful for scientists and readers to do prediction and related analysis.  </p>

      Caption: </span> This plot is made by python plotly. Data source is from dataset2, which includes the information about eruption era, countries and number of volcanoes. According to this plot, the volcano's active area is relatively stable. The first five most active areas are Indonesia, Japan, the United States, Russia and Chile. Since these countries are next to the earthquake zone, we are very familiar with them from different sources of social media. And according to the axis range of the scatter plot, we can also find that earth has become more and more inactive. In other words, volcanoes are going to go dormant. After searching on google, we found it might be because that magma from the Earth's mantle can no longer reach the volcanoes, and then they do not have enough energy to erupt.

The color of the point in this plot is marked as the status of VEI, which is a relative measure of the explosiveness of volcanic eruptions, from non-explosive to very large explosive. It can be observed that moderate explosive volcanoes are the most common and volcanoes are rarely non-explosive or large explosive, there are no volcanoes with very large explosiveness. As we can see, the duration of eruptions is evenly distributed over a period of one to two years.

      Caption: </span>This plot is created from the Python Plotly library. This interactive plot shows the distribution of volcano eruptions and earthquakes worldwide from 2010 to 2017. According to the plot, the red dots indicate the earthquakes that happen in a given month, and the blue dots represent the volcano eruptions. By moving the bar underplot, it shows the distribution of events at different time periods. Hovering over the dots tells the type of the event, the month of the event, and the longitude and latitude of the event. In addition, the plot supports the function of panning, zooming, and box selection. </p>

<p class="w3-medium w3-text-grey">This plot used two datasets, one is Significant Earthquake 1965-2016, and the other is the Volcano Eruption Global Distribution 2010-2018. Since the earthquake dataset has a much longer time period than the volcano one, the rows outside the time period of the volcano eruption dataset are filtered out.  </p>

<p class="w3-medium w3-text-grey">According to the plot, it can be seen that, in a given month, most volcano eruptions are surrounded by earthquakes. What is more, most volcano eruptions happen at places that historically had earthquakes. This observation is matched to the fact that volcanic eruptions and earthquakes are closely related geological movements. In addition, the visualization facilitates the data science story told earlier, the volcano eruption in Tonga is likely related to the earthquake, though the degree and specific timeline of earthquakes are unknown. </p>

This series of interactive visualization shows the descending order of the number of total deaths from volcano eruptions from 2010 to 2018. Since some countries have only a few entries of volcano eruptions, the data are presented as bars in the box plot. The volcano dataset has lots of missing values, here fill the missing values with the mean. This explains why many countries have the same number of total deaths. What is more, Indonesia has a much larger value at around 360, which results in the visualization in an uncoordinated design. In order to observe the total deaths in different countries in a better way, this project removes that row and plots a new visualization as df4_plot3.html, which gives a better comparison of how total deaths vary by country. </p>

The data used in this plot is from Volcano Eruption Global Distribution 2010-2018. According to the plot, many data points are at around total death of 19, this is because many missed values of this dataset are filled by the mean value. Ignore these numbers of total death at 19, you can still observe a slightly positive correlation between the elevation and number of deaths. However, there is not much information telling the different status of volcanoes distributed differently. </p>

According to the plot made by the support rule, D1(Volcano Time) might have a network with historical and Stratovolcano type. According to the plot made by the confidence rule, Stratovolcano is the connected feature, and in such circumstances U and D1 are both important Volcano Time. In the lift rule, it is kind of like the confidence rule. While it gives more connection to Indonesia with historical status.
